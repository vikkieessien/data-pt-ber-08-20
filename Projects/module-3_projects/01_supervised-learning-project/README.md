# Project: Supervised Learning

## Overview

There are many interesting use cases for Supervised Machine Learning. To name a few: prediction of the effectiveness of medical treatments, prediction of the exchange rates of foreign currencies, diagnosing Parkinson's disease just by listening to the voice of a patient, face recognition, recommendation of the news that are expected to be most interesting to a given user, etc. Choose one that motivates you and implement a solution using a Supervised Machine Learning algorithm of your choice. You don't have to start from zero: in the previous lessons you have read Python code snippets that you can adapt and reuse for you project, just make sure you understand what they do. This lesson does not present any new material at all, it is only intended as an opportunity to put into practice the knolwedge you learned in the previous lessons.

## Project Requirements

1. Your code needs to read a dataset stored on disk as input, and divide it into train and test set.
2. Your code needs to use the learned model to estimate the target value of problem instances.
3. Your code must compute a quality metric of the learned model.

## Technical Requirements

1. Use Python as programming language.
2. Use Pandas for reading the dataset into a pandas dataframe.
3. Use Scikit-learn for training and testing the Machine Learning model.

## Necessary Deliverables

1. Python code.
2. A brief presentation containing the dataset of your choice, the problem you are looking at and quality metrics of the model you implemented.

## Suggestions to Get Started
1. Find an interesting dataset! Look in the Useful Resources section for sources of ideas. At the same time, don't spend too much time picking and going into complexity - this is a mini-project, which should make you more comfortable with the supervised learning process start to finish. Find a dataset which is interesting for you, but also whose structure is suitable to supervised learning. You can also re-use a dataset from previous lessons or projects!
2. Break down the project into smaller tasks, for instance: importing the dataset, training, etc.
3. Re-use your code from the labs on supervised learning!

## What to Do When Feeling Stuck
If you get stuck at some stage of the project, and you cannot find a way out, you can try this:
1. Nothing you are asked to do in this project is new, you have examples of all the ingredients you need in the previous lessons. Go back to the previous lessons and review the procedure used there to move on.
2. Think at a level higher than the details of the problem, at the methodology level, and identify on what stage of the methodology you are stuck, and rephrase for yourself the reason why you are stuck, and why the solutions presented in the examples of the previous lessons are not helping you to find a solution.
3. Check with your peers whether they got stuck at the same point, and what they did to move on.
4. Consult with your instructor.
