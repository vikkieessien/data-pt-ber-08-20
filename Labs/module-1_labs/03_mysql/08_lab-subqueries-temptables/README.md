# Lab | Subqueries and Temp Tables

## Introduction

 In this lab, we will practice using subqueries and temporary tables to do more data processing.

Please submit your solutions in a text file `solutions.sql`.

### Challenge

In this challenge, please create a table which for each author contains their author ID, last name, first name, number of total titles and the sum of royalties they have received,

In a second step, we from this table would then like to calculate the average royalty per title each author has received. The final table should contain for each author their author ID, last name, first name and average royalty calculated as sum of royalties divided by title count.

Solve this challenge in two ways: first, by using a subquery. Then, by creating a temporary table.
