# Lab | Parsing API Data

## Introduction

This is a simple introduction to APIs with an open and available API: Coingecko API.
- Before you start: investigate the coingecko API documentation that shows you the complete workflow of querying data from their API and parsing them, and complete the small exercises in the "main.ipynb" file. You can find the link in the file!


## Getting Started


Open `main.ipynb`. You'll create your own API parsing program that works with the coingecko API.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
