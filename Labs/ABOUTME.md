# Hello world
 
* My name is Victoria Essien, I'm into Digital marketing and I have 6 years of experience across a broad range of marketing functions, both online and offline*. I have strong experience with Google Analytics, Google AdWords and other SEM analysis tools and experience in SEA, SEO and Photoshop, also experience with Excel, Microsoft office. I have the ability to combine vision, ingenuity, and strong business acumen with well driven project management and leadership qualities to support go to-market efforts, products launches, and branding/rebranding initiatives, positioning companies and products for success.

* I love customer satisfaction and retention to promote continous growth in sales. I'm currently switching career to Data Analytics and it entails working on company's database of clients to promote bottom line and I love the transferable skills I'm bringing to my new career as a Data Analyst. Data Analytics is completely new to me and I am ready to learn and excel in this new path. Although I am currently facing challenges and depressing moments especially when I am not getting most of the in-class taught topics, not to mention the labs!

* I promise to handle this new face excellently well and become the best and greater Data Analyst.
* This is conflict.
